# Intermediate Ray Tracer Tutorial

This program serves to demonstrate the concept of ray tracing by building on [Basic Ray Tracer tutorial](https://github.com/igme-rit/basic-ray-tracer-tutorial).

# About

This builds off of a previous Basic Ray Tracer, adding in the concept of light and shadow. There are four point lights, and this uses diffuse and specular lighting.

# Setup

In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor. Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
