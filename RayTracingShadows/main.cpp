// This function takes in variables that define the perspective view of the camera, then outputs the four corner rays of the camera's view.
// It takes in a vec3 eye, which is the position of the camera.
// It also takes vec3 center, the position the camera's view is centered on.
// Then it will takes a vec3 up which is a vector that defines the upward direction. (So if you point it down, the camera view will be upside down.)
// Then it takes a float defining the verticle field of view angle. It also takes a float defining the ratio of the screen (in this case, 800/600 pixels).
// The last four parameters are actually just variables for this function to output data into. They should be pointers to pre-defined vec4 variables.
